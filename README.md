# CS50_Lecture_1_hello
Following along with L_1 of Web Programming with Python and Javascript
The week one lecture is all about git so I am using this repo to mimic what Brian Yu does in the lecture to make sure I have the hang of it.
This was the first repo I created and at first I just committed one version of the hello.html file on 25th May 2021
